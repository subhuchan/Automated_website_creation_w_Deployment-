# üîß Fix: Google Generative AI Module Not Found

## Problem
The backend is failing with: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'`

This happens because uvicorn is using Python 3.11, but the package is installed in Python 3.14.

## Solution

### Option 1: Run the Install Script (Easiest)
```bash
install_missing_packages.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

```bash
python -m pip install google-generativeai==0.8.3
```

Or if you have multiple Python versions:

```bash
py -3.11 -m pip install google-generativeai==0.8.3
```

### Option 3: Install All Requirements

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## After Installation

1. Restart the backend:
   - Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: `cd backend`
   - Run: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

2. Try creating a project again from http://localhost:5173

## Verify Installation

Run this to check if the package is installed:

```bash
python -c "import google.generativeai as genai; print('‚úÖ Package installed!')"
```

## Why This Happened

The `backend/requirements.txt` includes `google-generativeai==0.8.3`, but it wasn't installed when we ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` earlier because:
1. Multiple Python versions on the system
2. The package was installed in Python 3.14 user site-packages
3. But uvicorn is running with Python 3.11

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Backend running
- ‚úÖ USER_SECRET loaded correctly
- ‚úÖ Database initialized
- ‚ùå google-generativeai not available in Python 3.11
- ‚ùå Project creation will fail until package is installed

## Next Steps

1. Run `install_missing_packages.bat`
2. Restart backend
3. Try creating a project
4. Check backend logs for success!
