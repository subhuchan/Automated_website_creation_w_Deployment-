# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Fixed!

## ✅ Docker Issues Resolved

I've removed the Docker files and configured Railway to use Nixpacks (Railway's native builder).

## 📝 What Changed:

- ❌ Removed `docker-compose.yml`
- ❌ Removed `docker/backend.Dockerfile`
- ❌ Removed `docker/frontend.Dockerfile`
- ✅ Added `nixpacks.toml` (Railway configuration)
- ✅ Added `Procfile` (start command)
- ✅ Updated `railway.toml`

## 🚀 Deploy to Railway Now:

### Step 1: Railway Will Auto-Detect

Railway will now automatically:
- Detect Python 3.11 for backend
- Detect Node.js 18 for frontend
- Install dependencies
- Build frontend
- Start backend server

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these variables:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
GITHUB_USERNAME=subhuchan
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
USER_SECRET=your_secret
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./tds_projects.db
PORT=8000
```

### Step 3: Deploy!

Railway will automatically redeploy with the new configuration.

## 🎯 What Railway Will Do:

1. **Install Phase**:
   - Install Python packages from `backend/requirements.txt`
   - Install Node packages from `frontend/package.json`

2. **Build Phase**:
   - Build React frontend (`npm run build`)

3. **Start Phase**:
   - Start FastAPI backend on port $PORT
   - Serve frontend static files

## ✅ Expected Result:

You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

The app will serve:
- Frontend at: `/`
- Backend API at: `/api/v1/`
- Health check at: `/api/v1/health`

## 🐛 If It Still Fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Deployments"
   - Click latest deployment
   - Check build and deploy logs

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure all variables are set
   - No typos in variable names

3. **Try Manual Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy" button in Railway dashboard
   - This will trigger a fresh build

## 💡 Alternative: Deploy Backend Only

If you want to deploy just the backend on Railway:

1. **Update `nixpacks.toml`**:
   ```toml
   [phases.setup]
   nixPkgs = ["python311"]

   [phases.install]
   cmds = ["cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"]

   [start]
   cmd = "cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
   ```

2. **Deploy frontend separately** to Vercel/Netlify

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Railway should now deploy successfully without Docker errors!
