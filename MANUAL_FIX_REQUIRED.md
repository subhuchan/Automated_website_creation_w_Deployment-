# ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

## Issue Found
The backend cannot create repositories because the `google-generativeai` package is missing from Python 3.11.

## Error in Backend
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'
```

## üîß How to Fix (Choose ONE method)

### Method 1: Simple Command (RECOMMENDED)

Open a **NEW Command Prompt** window and run:

```bash
python -m pip install google-generativeai==0.8.3
```

### Method 2: With Specific Python Version

If you have multiple Python versions:

```bash
py -3.11 -m pip install google-generativeai==0.8.3
```

### Method 3: Install All Requirements

```bash
cd C:\Users\adity\OneDrive\Desktop\TDS_PROJECT_1\tds-project-1-main\tds-project-1-main\backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## After Installation

1. **Stop the backend** (press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)

2. **Restart the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Try creating a project again** from http://localhost:5173

## Verify It Worked

After restarting, try creating a project. Check the backend terminal - you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more "ModuleNotFoundError"
- ‚úÖ "Starting project generation..."
- ‚úÖ "Repository created..."
- ‚úÖ "Code generated..."

## Why This Happened

The package list in `backend/requirements.txt` includes `google-generativeai==0.8.3`, but:
- It was installed in Python 3.14's user packages
- But uvicorn is running with Python 3.11
- So Python 3.11 can't find the package

## Current Status

‚úÖ Backend running on http://localhost:8000
‚úÖ Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
‚úÖ USER_SECRET loaded: `subhashree_secret_123`
‚úÖ Database initialized
‚úÖ Secret validation working
‚ùå **google-generativeai package missing** ‚Üê FIX THIS

## What Will Work After Fix

Once you install the package and restart:
1. ‚úÖ Create projects from the frontend
2. ‚úÖ AI will generate code using Gemini
3. ‚úÖ GitHub repos will be created
4. ‚úÖ GitHub Pages will be enabled
5. ‚úÖ You'll get links to your live sites!

**Please run the installation command above, then restart the backend!**
