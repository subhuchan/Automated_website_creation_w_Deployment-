# 🔍 Debug Instructions

## Backend is Ready with Debug Logging!

The backend is now running with detailed debug output that will show:
- The secret received from the frontend
- The secret expected by the backend
- Whether they match
- The exact bytes if they don't match

## ✅ Backend Status:
- Running on: http://localhost:8000
- USER_SECRET loaded: `'subhashree_secret_123'` (length: 21)
- Debug logging: ENABLED

## 📝 Steps to Debug:

### 1. Try Creating a Project from Frontend

Go to: http://localhost:5173

Click "Builder" and fill in:
- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Secret**: `subhashree_secret_123` ← Copy this exactly!
- **Task ID**: `debug-test-002`
- **Brief**: `Create a simple test page`

### 2. Click "Generate Application"

### 3. Check Backend Terminal

Look for output like this:
```
🔍 DEBUG: Received secret: 'subhashree_secret_123'
🔍 DEBUG: Expected secret: 'subhashree_secret_123'
🔍 DEBUG: Secrets match: True
```

OR if it fails:
```
🔍 DEBUG: Received secret: 'something_else'
🔍 DEBUG: Expected secret: 'subhashree_secret_123'
🔍 DEBUG: Secrets match: False
❌ SECRET MISMATCH!
   Received length: XX
   Expected length: 21
   Received bytes: b'...'
   Expected bytes: b'subhashree_secret_123'
```

## 🎯 What to Look For:

1. **If secrets match** → Project should be created successfully!
2. **If secrets don't match** → The debug output will show exactly what was received vs expected

## 📋 Copy This Secret Exactly:

```
subhashree_secret_123
```

- No spaces before or after
- Exactly 21 characters
- Case-sensitive
- No special characters except underscore

## 🔧 Alternative: Test with API Directly

If you want to test without the frontend, run this in a new terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/builder/create ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"secret\":\"subhashree_secret_123\",\"task\":\"api-test-001\",\"round\":1,\"nonce\":\"test-123\",\"brief\":\"Test\",\"checks\":[],\"evaluation_url\":\"https://httpbin.org/post\",\"attachments\":[]}"
```

Then check the backend terminal for the debug output!

**Ready to test! Try creating a project now and tell me what you see in the backend terminal.**
